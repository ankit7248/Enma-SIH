<hr> </hr>

<h1> Idea /Concept </h1>
<p>
  IP Explorer is an adventure-based mobile game that takes students on a journey to explore the
world of intellectual property. The game is designed to educate students about various aspects
of IP, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets, while also encouraging
critical thinking and problem-solving.
</p>

<p>
The game features a map with different locations, each representing a unique aspect of IP (e.g.,
Copyright Castle, Trademark Town, Patent Park).
Students embark on quests within each location to learn about IP concepts. For example, in
Copyright Castle, they might help a fictional author protect their work from plagiarism.
